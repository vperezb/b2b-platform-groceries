# International

The platform should be build with the international expansion in mind.

# Content AutoScaling

From a content point of view the manual work needed to mantain the platform should be close to zero once the deploy is done.

# Flexibility

The users should drive the content architecture (categories / product tags) as it's done on twitter. Then, if it's a success we can add a human-designed architecture such as manual product selections.

That means we can't elaborate a limited list of categories or tags neither build a strict and static breadcrumb.
